    #   - RANDOM: Bet on a random outcome

    #   - MOST_INDIVIDUALS: Bet on the outcome with the most individual bets
    #   - MOST_INDIVIDUAL_POINTS: Bet on the outcome with the highest individual point bet
    #   - CAUTIOUS: This will track previous outcome results and use that information to bet on the outcome that has the highest return on investment
    #               For example if we know that an outcome has a 25% chance of winning but currently only has 10% of the points bet on it, we will bet on that outcome
